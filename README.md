## QuickBite Express Crisis Recovery

This project analyzes the Pre-Crisis vs Crisis business performance of QuickBite Express, identifying operational challenges, customer behavior changes, and restaurant-level performance issues.
It aims to provide data-driven insights and recommendations to support crisis recovery and decision-making.

## Project Overview

QuickBite Express faced a major decline in revenue, order volume, and customer satisfaction during a crisis.
Using Power BI, I built an end-to-end analytical solution to uncover:

Causes of revenue and order decline
Customer retention and churn patterns
City-wise and restaurant-wise performance
Delivery delays and SLA compliance issues
Behavior of top 5% high-value customers

## Key Features

✔ Clean star-schema data model built from multiple fact & dimension tables
✔ 20+ custom DAX measures for KPIs and trend analysis
✔ Pre-crisis vs crisis performance comparison
✔ Restaurant partnership performance analysis
✔ Delivery SLA compliance and delay analysis
✔ High-value customer lifetime decline analysis
✔ Customer churn, retention & loyalty segmentation
✔ Fully interactive Power BI dashboard
