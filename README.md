## QuickBite Express Crisis Recovery

This project analyzes the Pre-Crisis vs Crisis business performance of QuickBite Express, identifying operational challenges, customer behavior changes, and restaurant-level performance issues.
It aims to provide data-driven insights and recommendations to support crisis recovery and decision-making.
